          <h3>MPW64: Two Days On</h3>
          <p>Lincoln County Fire Protection District's Station No. 1 in Troy, Mo., is the only 24 hour manned fire station in the county. Covering 160 square miles of farmland, city and forest, the firemen from the station responded to 1,500 calls last year and extinguished 350 fires.</p>

          <p>Firefighters work a "two-day-on, four-day-off" schedule. During those two days (and nights) they live at the firehouse together, training, doing maintenance, working with volunteers and attending to their families and lives as best they can. The calls run the gamut from medical emergencies to structure fires to car accidents to catastrophic floods. For 48 hours each week they work and live together to protect and aid Lincoln County residents.</p>

        <h3>About Missouri Photo Workshop</h3>
        <p>The Missouri Photo Workshop has been documenting life in small town Missouri since being founded by Cliff Edom in 1949. For one week each year, photographers inhabit, learn, and tell the stories of a different small town in Missouri. The workshop still holds true to Cliff Edom's credo: <span>"Show truth with a camera. Ideally truth is a matter of personal integrity. In no circumstances will a posed or faked photograph be tolerated."</span> </p>

        <p>I attended the 64th Missouri Photo Workshop in 2012, and spent a week with the firefighters of Lincoln County Fire Protection Station No. 1</p>
