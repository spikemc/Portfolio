            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Destinations is a travel strategy game created by Natalie Be'er, Steve Klise, Paul May and myself for our Big Games class at ITP. Players jetset around the world, collecting points as they "control" countries around the world. </p>

            <p>The players can see a real time scoreboard and book flights through an online web app, and receive SMS messages when their flights have landed or taken off. Additionally, players were able to see the current state of the world on a physical game board put up at ITP. </p>

            <p>Players gain points by "controlling" countries. Countries are controlled by the user after their flight departments the country, and are controlled until another user lands in that country. The player in control gains points per hour. The countries are worth a varying number of points, depending on how many connections the player can make in country. A country with only two connections is more difficult to get to, and thus worth more. 

            </p>
            
            <p>Flight times vary between 30 mins and 2 hours. Users must balance flight times, country point value, and the current world map to figure the most advantageous country to go to next. </p>
