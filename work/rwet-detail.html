          <p>Reading and Writing Electronic Text is a class taught at ITP by Adam Parrish. From the class website:</p>

          <p>This course introduces the Python programming language as a tool for reading and writing digital text. This course is specifically geared to serve as a general-purpose introduction to programming in Python, but will be of special interest to students interested in poetics, language, creative writing and text analysis.</p>

          <p>For my final, I took the works of playwright Charles Mee and re-imagined them using Python. Mee worked with found and reconstituted texts, and so manipulating his texts seemed appropriate. I ended up with a few pieces, created using markov chains.</p> 

          <p>There is a constant simulcast projection on a big screen<br>
          and make her own world to live in.<br>
          I know you want to<br>
          Forget about exchanging loving glances across any part of the house.<br>
          They work together, learn together<br>
          and returning to her dressing room<br>
          For the first time in history<br>
          Don't you lose your head<br>
          And after a while, over the music,<br>
          the ground crew joins the umpires for a full cast rain delay dance.<br>
          This is humiliating to different degrees for each of them.<br>
          Hallelujah it's raining men, Amen<br>
          At just about half past ten<br>
          I feel stormy weather moving in</p>

          <p>I read this piece at the final presentation poetry reading for the class:</p>

          <p>Stuff is a happenin.<br>
          Which is a good thing. I hope!<br>
          and i saw the black van pull up front<br>
          and i tried to make myelf not seen<br>
          and got out and reeked havoc on the place<br>
          I was in the backyard<br>
          and got out,<br>
          and i tried to make myelf not seen<br>
          and I thought i was crazy,<br>
          and I thought i was crazy,<br>
          I was in a parking lot<br>
          and these evil cat people with their claws<br>
          but Kim lived there in my dream,<br>
          I get the feeling like "this is why i'm here."<br>
          and i saw the black van pull up front<br>
          and my friend Kim's house,<br>
          but Kim lived there in my dream,<br>
          and i saw the black van pull up front<br>
          Stuff is a happenin.<br>
          and my friend Kim's house,<br>
          Stuff is a happenin.<br>
          It'll change soon. I hope!<br>
          I get the feeling like "this is why i'm here."<br>
          What does this all mean?<br>
          Which is a good thing. I hope.<br>
          and somehow i wound up hiding in their bathroom<br>
          coming out of an event or a concert of someone's car,<br>
          and my friend Kim's house,<br>
          and got out,<br>
          and got out,<br>
          and i saw the black van pull up front<br>
          It'll change soon. I hope.<br>
          and walked to the neighbors backyard<br>
          blowing things up and killing people with their claws<br>
          and somehow i wound up hiding in their bathroom<br>
          It'll change soon. I hope.<br>
          and got out and reeked havoc on the place<br>
          and i saw the black van pull up front<br>
          I was in the backyard<br>
          and walked to the neighbors backyard<br>
          and i tried to make myelf not seen<br>
          and for some reason I was taken to my friend Kim's house,<br>
          and got out,<br>
          What does this all mean?<br>
          and these evil cat people with their claws<br>
          and walked to the neighbors backyard<br>
          SO life is ok.<br>
          blowing things up and killing people with their claws<br>
          It'll change soon. I hope.</p>


          <p>Finally, I'm interested in remixing the works of Mee and performing them. I repeatedly ran a selection of text through a Markov chain, alternating the length until I ended up with the following text. I initially assigned two "characters" to read, and added another "character" every time the text suggest another person entered the scene. I would like to continue playing with text this way to create a programmatic scene. </p>

          <p>1: I need an older man<br>
          2: pours it into a bath with your genitals.<br>
          1: this is the only time they're not here.<br>
          3: [Polly, emerging from the garbage.<br>
          3: And maybe not, by the rules<br>
          1: You'd be talking about nothing to put me<br>
          2: And maybe not, by the rules<br>
          3: the reason the Lord's Prayer goes<br>
          4: Then he gets up slowly,<br>
          4: not running of the hydraulic hoist,<br>
          1: looking back and savage me<br>
          2: looking back and savage me<br>
          3: this is the only time they're not here.<br>
          4: not a randy young man<br>
          1: I forgot.<br>
          2: this is the only time they're not here.<br>
          3: A chain, with a woman's breast, you know--<br>
          4: this is the only time they're not here.<br>
          1: A chain, with a woman's breast, you know--<br>
          2: I've got to say?<br>
          3: I forgot.<br>
          4: Then he gets up slowly, not running of the politicians want is for me.<br>
          5: RED DICKS joins the deepest fact about a boy<br>
          5: you might still be able to pump gas<br>

          2: the reason the Lord's Prayer goes<br>
          3: I remember that.<br>
          4: A chain, with a woman's breast, you know--<br>
          5: men's lives.<br>
          1: looking back and savage me<br>
          2: Sometimes when you that they did<br>
          3: looking back and savage me<br>
          4: Did you ask?<br>
          5: You'd be talking about nothing to put me<br>
          1: You'd be talking about nothing to put me<br>
          2: Doesn't he love she may settle down,<br>
          3: not a randy young man<br>
          4: You'd be talking about nothing to put me<br>
          5: Sometimes, will with lighter fluid,<br>
          1: You'd be talking about nothing to put me<br>
          2: Did you ask?<br>
          3: I can understand if some of which were burdensome<br>
          4: with warmth<br>
          5: the divorce in sight<br>
          1: this is the only time they're not here.<br>

          3: this is the only time they're not here.<br>
          4: the divorce in sight<br>
          5: I remember that.<br>
          1: A chain, with a woman's breast, you know--<br>
          2: and it just started laughing<br>
          3: and sings vocals from the garbage.<br>
          4: looking back and savage me<br>
          5: A chain, with a woman's breast, you know--<br>
          1: Sometimes, will with lighter fluid,<br>
          2: I forgot.<br>
          3: men's lives.<br>
          4: Doesn't he love she may settle down,<br>

          3: the divorce in sight<br>
          1: I forgot.<br>
