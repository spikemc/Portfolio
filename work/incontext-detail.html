            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>In Context is a web product design to help users explore the New York Time's extensive archive. It was designed by Carl Eveleigh, Diana Huang, Allison Eve Zell and myself for our Interaction Design class at ITP.</p>

      			<p>As a prompt for our final, we were presented with a question from the New York Times interaction design team: how could they make their archive more accessible? Given that the Times has been publishing since 1851, they have a hugely impressive historical record of the US and abroad. In order to bring more users to the archive, we decided to leverage it to give users more information about the article they were currently reading. We sought to give crucial context to current news, context which the Times was uniquely situated to provide. Thus, the name: In Context. </p>

      			<p>Users access In Context from the article page. When they click on the In Context button they are brought to the In Conext page. The page displays five related articles, created from text analysis of the original article. The articles are meant to give further depth and substance to the original article. The articles are pulled from the archive and meant to illustrate and explain the issues and players within the original article. </p>

            <p><a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2012/01/meet-deep-dive-the-new-york-times-experimental-context-engine-and-story-explorer/">Coincidentally, the Times released a similar product shortly after we presented InContext to them at the paper</a></p>
